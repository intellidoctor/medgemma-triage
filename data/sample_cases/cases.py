# Sample cases from: https://codimg.com/healthcare/blog/en/manchester-triage-system#:~:text=The%20Manchester%20Triage%20System%20is,So%2C%20let's%20get%20started%E2%80%A6
# Patient A: A male, 60, presents complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. The triage nurse on duty suspects a heart attack and classifies him as Red (Immediate) as this is a potentially life-threatening situation.
 

# Patient B: A 30-year-old female presents with a high fever and severe abdominal pain. She is categorised as Orange (Very Urgent), as her symptoms may indicate appendicitis, which could require urgent surgery.
 

# Patient C: A 7-year-old child with a mild fever and sore throat is classified as Green (Standard). The symptoms, undoubtedly, require attention, but it is highly unlikely that they represent an immediate risk to the child.
 

# Patient D: A 25-year-old male presents with a suspected sprained ankle. This is categorised as Blue (Non-Urgent), as his injury, while uncomfortable, doesn’t require urgent intervention.
